        <h3>Hi!</h3>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Tennis is my favorite hobby as it is energetic and fun.Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will. It requires alot of energy to play this game
